## Design system & atomic components

Apps **must** use the shared Buddy design system (tokens + atomic components) from `shared-buddy` / `BuddyUI`.

- Do not invent one-off colors, radii, or spacing in this app.
- Compose screens from atoms/molecules; upstream new UI to `BuddyUI`.
- Full contract: [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) (source of truth also in shared-buddy).
